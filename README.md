AS3-Demo - August 2014 - Nicola Valcasara
========

Demo for salvatore. It contains code for: lighting, pathfinding and animations.

Written on actionscript3. Using the following libraries:
  - starling
  - nape
  - starling-lighting extension by Ryan Speets
  - polygon clipper by Angus Johnson
  - Hi-res stats

support graphic made by Darroch McNaught

The SalvatoreDemo.swf will show a menu with 3 chioces:

  - lighting
  - pathfinding with PoS
  - animations
  
lighting scene:
  - similar to the demo scene of starling. A button on the top will show a new feature of the lighting class every time it is clicked
  
pathfinding scene:
  - 4 buttons on the top: load example, draw, calculate navmesh, search path
  - 2 toggler: show nodes, show navmesh
  - a white drawboard
  The user can draw any kind of polygon by clicking on the scene with the left click. anytime the user click on the origin point of the current polygon a polygon is drawn and added to the map. User can also "substract" polygons by hitting "V" on the keyboard when drawing the polygon

The pathfining class use the Dijkstra alghoritm and the navMesh map generated is a "point of Sight" method between nodes.

Animation Scene:
  It will show an animation generated by a spritesheet and a texture atlas. The user can see the different animation blended by the AnimTree Class
